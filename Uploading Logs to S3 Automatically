3. Uploading Logs to S3 Automatically
Configure an AWS Lambda function to push new logs to S3:
import boto3

def upload_to_s3():
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = "real-time-log-bucket"
    file_name = "/mnt/efs/logs.txt"
    s3.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, "processed_logs/logs.txt")

upload_to_s3()
