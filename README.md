# Scalable-Real-Time-Data-Pipeline-Using-AWS-S3-EFS-Redshift-
In this project, I have designed and deployed a data pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze real-time log data using AWS S3, EFS, and Redshift. This project shows that I can improve data accessibility and enable faster decision-making with optimized storage and query performance.
